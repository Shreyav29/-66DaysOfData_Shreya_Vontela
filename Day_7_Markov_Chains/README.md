# Markov Property 
- Markov property states that the future state of a process depends only on the present state and does not depend on past history. Hence, the Markov process is said to have the memoryless property.

- Today I tried to simulate this property using a simple example. In the notebook, we can see that irrespective of the strting state, the process becomes stationary eventually.
